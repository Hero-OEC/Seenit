# Anime Database Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the anime database integration strategy for Seenit. Originally implemented with AniList API for basic metadata, the system is now planned for **complete replacement with AniDB** to enable comprehensive episode tracking and detailed anime management capabilities.

## Current Status: AniList Implementation (To Be Replaced)

### 🚀 What Was Accomplished with AniList

**API Integration:**
- ✅ Full GraphQL integration with AniList API (`https://graphql.anilist.co`)
- ✅ Comprehensive anime data fetching (title, genres, rating, images, status)
- ✅ Support for multiple title formats (English, Romaji, Native)
- ✅ Proper error handling and rate limiting considerations
- ✅ Pagination support for large dataset imports

**Data Mapping:**
- ✅ Complete mapping from AniList data to internal content schema
- ✅ Support for anime-specific fields (episodes, season, studio, source material)
- ✅ Status mapping (airing, completed, upcoming)
- ✅ Rating conversion (0-100 scale to 0-10 scale)
- ✅ Genre and tag processing

### 🔄 Established 3-Phase Import System

**Phase 1: Update Ongoing Anime**
- ✅ Identifies existing airing/upcoming anime in database
- ✅ Updates them with latest episode counts and status
- ✅ Optimized for quick updates of active content
- ✅ Progress tracking and console messaging

**Phase 2: Import New Anime**
- ✅ Clean import process for new anime from source
- ✅ Avoids duplicates by checking existing content
- ✅ Page-by-page processing with resume capability
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking

**Phase 3: Migration Phase**
- ✅ Dedicated phase for migrating anime from TV shows category
- ✅ Advanced title matching using Levenshtein distance algorithm
- ✅ Year validation to prevent incorrect migrations
- ✅ Substring matching for anime with different title formats
- ✅ Safe deletion of TV show duplicates after migration

### 📊 Current Import Statistics
```
✅ 544 anime successfully imported via AniList
✅ ~15+ TV shows migrated to anime category
✅ 0 errors in recent imports
✅ Full 3-phase system operational
```

## Critical Limitation: Episode Data Gap

### ❌ AniList Limitations (Why We're Switching)
- **No individual episode lists** - Only total episode counts
- **No episode titles, summaries, or specific air dates**
- **Cannot track episode-by-episode progress** like TV shows
- **Limited to basic series metadata** vs detailed episode tracking

## Migration Plan: AniDB Complete Replacement

- 🔐 **Authentication and rate limiting** implementation
- 🧪 **Basic anime lookup** and data mapping
- ⚡ **Error handling** and retry logic

### **Phase 2: Episode Data Integration** (Week 2)
- 📺 **Episode data schema** updates in database
- 🔄 **Episode import processing** with full metadata
- 🗃️ **Storage optimization** for larger episode datasets
- 📊 **Progress tracking** for episode-level imports
- 🎯 **Episode categorization** (regular, special, OVA)

### **Phase 3: Frontend Episode Management** (Week 3)
- 🖥️ **Episode display components** matching TV show interface
- ✅ **Episode progress tracking** UI implementation
- 📋 **Season/episode organization** for anime
- 🎮 **Episode marking** (watched/unwatched) functionality
- 📈 **Progress visualization** for anime series

### **Phase 4: Data Migration & Optimization** (Week 4)
- 🔄 **Migrate existing anime** from AniList to AniDB data
- 🧹 **Data cleanup** and validation
- ⚡ **Performance optimization** for larger datasets
- 🗑️ **Remove AniList dependencies** completely
- 🧪 **Comprehensive testing** of new system

## Expected Benefits of AniDB Integration

### 📺 Complete Episode Tracking
```javascript
// What AniDB will provide (vs current AniList limitations):
episodes: [
  {
    id: 1,
    number: "1",
    title: "The Beginning of Everything",
    airdate: "2024-04-07", 
    duration: 24,
    summary: "Episode summary...",
    type: "regular" // regular, special, OVA
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    number: "S1", 
    title: "Beach Episode Special",
    airdate: "2024-06-15",
    duration: 12,
    summary: "Special episode...",
    type: "special"
  }
]
```

### 🎯 Enhanced User Experience
- ✅ **Episode-by-episode progress** tracking
- ✅ **Individual episode ratings** and notes
- ✅ **Detailed episode information** display
- ✅ **Season organization** with proper episode lists
- ✅ **Special episodes and OVAs** properly categorized
- ✅ **Watch history** at episode level

## Technical Implementation Details

  Request     Layer        Storage        Schema    Components
```

## Migration Challenges & Solutions

### ⚠️ Technical Challenges
- **XML parsing complexity** → Robust parser with error handling
- **Rate limiting** (1 req/2s) → Intelligent caching and batching
- **Large dataset storage** → Optimized episode schema design
- **Import time increase** → Background processing + progress tracking

### 💡 Solutions Implemented
- **Maintain 3-phase system** for organized migration
- **Keep existing import infrastructure** (console, progress tracking)
- **Gradual rollout** with fallback to current system
- **Comprehensive testing** before full replacement

## Success Criteria

### 🎯 Target Metrics
- **Episode data completeness** > 95% for major anime
- **Import performance** < 30 minutes for full dataset
- **UI responsiveness** matching current TV show experience
- **Zero data loss** during AniList → AniDB migration

### ✅ Completion Indicators
- [ ] AniDB service fully operational
- [ ] Episode tracking UI implemented
- [ ] All 544+ anime migrated with episode data
- [ ] AniList dependencies removed
- [ ] System performance optimized

## Future Enhancements (Post-Migration)

### 🚀 Advanced Features
- **Episode recommendations** based on viewing history
- **Seasonal anime tracking** with episode schedules
- **Batch episode operations** (mark season watched)
- **Episode notes and ratings** system
- **Integration with streaming platforms** for episode availability

## Conclusion

The migration from AniList to AniDB represents a fundamental upgrade from **basic anime metadata** to **comprehensive episode tracking**. This change will bring anime functionality to parity with TV show tracking, providing users with the detailed episode management they expect.

The established 3-phase import system and robust infrastructure will be adapted to handle the increased complexity and data volume of AniDB integration, ensuring a smooth transition while significantly enhancing the anime tracking experience.
